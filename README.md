# Discord Bot 1.0 

This Discord Bot is written in [Java](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), utilizing the [Discord4J](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) API, and is inspired by SexualRhinoceros' [MusicBot](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot)<br>

### Setting up

If you do not have a bot application created yet, click [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. The 'app name' will be your bot's username. The 'app icon' will be your bot's icon. Don't add any URIs. App description can be left empty. Example:

![application](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24867967/21583888/a5a410fe-d061-11e6-9a18-5b7a7293b88e.png?raw=true)

After you've created your application, click 'Create a Bot User.'

![bot user](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24867967/21583922/ac315b60-d062-11e6-9057-55b22f08b93e.png?raw=true)

You should now see this:

![app bot user](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24867967/21583936/4b8c4b16-d063-11e6-9411-6c51ebc9ece7.png?raw=true)

Click the 'click to reveal' button in text and copy the token. You will need this to authenticate your bot to the discord servers.

### Editing Settings.ini

If you don't have Java installed yet, click [here](https://java.com/en/download/) to download the latest available version.

If your OS is Windows, please don't use notepad! Instead, consider downloading a dedicated text editor with .ini supported syntax highlighting such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
