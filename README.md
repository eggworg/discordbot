# Discord Bot 1.0 

This Discord Bot is written in [Java](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), utilizing the [Discord4J](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) API, and is inspired by SexualRhinoceros' [MusicBot](https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot)<br>

### Setting up

If you don't have Java installed yet, click [here](https://java.com/en/download/) to download the latest available version.

If your OS is Windows, please don't use notepad! Instead, consider downloading a dedicated text editor with .ini supported syntax highlighting such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

If you do not have a bot application created yet, click [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. The 'app name' will be your bot's username. The 'app icon' will be your bot's icon. Don't add any URIs. App description can be left empty. Example:
